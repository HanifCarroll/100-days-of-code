# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Discord Logger Bot. Removed some fluff from the bot, and added 'youtu.be' to list of domains to check. Practiced implementing bubble sort algorithm from memory that I learned earlier today.

**Thoughts:** I also attempted to utilize some thumbnail resizing package for the Django back-end, but it ended up 1. Giving me an error with the migrations I was supposed to run, and 2. It didn't work exactly how I thought it would, anyway. If I were going to use it, I would have to use it when the media object is saved, then create a smaller thumbnail image and host the URL somewhere, probably on S3. That just seems like more trouble than it's worth right now, but I might look into it for the future.
